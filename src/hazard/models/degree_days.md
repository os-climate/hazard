Degree days indicators are calculated by integrating over time the absolute difference in temperature
of the medium over a reference temperature. The exact method of calculation may vary;
here the daily average temperature is used to calculate an annual indicator:
$$
I^\text{dd} = \sum_{i = 1}^{365} |  T^\text{avg}_i - T^\text{ref} | \nonumber
$$
$I^\text{dd}$ is the indicator, $T^\text{avg}$ is the daily average surface temperature
and $T^\text{ref}$ is the reference temperature of 32°C. The OS-Climate-generated indicators are inferred
from CMIP6 data, averaged over 6 models: ACCESS-CM2, CMCC-ESM2, CNRM-CM6-1, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, MIROC6 and NorESM2-MM.
The indicators are generated for periods: 'historical' (averaged over 1995-2014), 2030 (2021-2040), 2040 (2031-2050)
and 2050 (2041-2060).

Applications for indicators based on surface temperature degree days include models of:
- heating and cooling requirements
- labour loss caused by extreme heat
