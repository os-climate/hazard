Flood depth for riverine floods occurring in Europe in the present and future climate, including protection levels
from the FLOPROS database.
Based on the CLMcom-CCLM4-8-17-EC-EARTH regional climate simulation (EURO-CORDEX), sets are available for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5
for projected (central) years 2035 and 2085. The set has a spatial resolution of 100m and comprises return periods of
10, 30, 100, 300 and 1000 years.

The data set is [here](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/df7b63b0-1114-4515-a562-117ca165dc5b), part of the 
[RAIN data set](https://data.4tu.nl/collections/1e84bf47-5838-40cb-b381-64d3497b3b36)
(Risk Analysis of Infrastructure Networks in Response to Extreme Weather). The RAIN report is
[here](http://rain-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/D2.5_REPORT_final.pdf).

To derive this indicator, 'River_flood_extent_X_Y_Z_with_protection' and 'River_flood_depth_X_Y_Z_R' data sets are combined to
yield protected flood depths.
