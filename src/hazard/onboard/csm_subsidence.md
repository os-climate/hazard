# Global map of land subsidence rates (Davydzenka et al. (2024))

Land subsidence refers to gradual settlement or rapid sinking of the ground that can occur as a result of natural factors (e.g., volcanic or seismic activity, collapse of subsurface cavities, compaction of loose fine-grained deposits) or anthropogenic activities (e.g., excessive groundwater (GW) abstraction, mining, subsurface energy extraction). It is a destructive phenomenon occurring around the globe causing damage to infrastructure, increased flood risks, and reduction of aquifer storage. However, prediction and quantification of land subsidence rates globally using physics-based methods presents a major challenge. Capitalizing on the robustness of modern deep learning methods and taking advantage of the increasingly available data sets of environmental parameters, the study [here](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104497) introduces the first map of land subsidence rates on a global scale with a spatial resolution of 30 Ã— 30 arc seconds (approx. 1 km at the equator).
