Maximum 10 metre 3 second gust peak wind speed (note 3 second average; by default physrisk wind speeds are 1 minute average) for different return periods, inferred from the Copernicus WISC European storm event set. This allows events and return period maps to be used consistently.

https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-european-wind-storm-synthetic-events?tab=overview

The WISC dataset contains a set of synthetic windstorm events consisting of 22,980 individual
storm footprints over Europe. These are a physically realistic set of plausible windstorm
events based on the modelled climatic conditions, calculated using the Met Office HadGEM3 model
(Global Atmosphere 3 and Global Land 3 configurations).
Return period maps of peak gust wind speed are inferred from this data.
