Global data set of protection levels for riverine and coastal flood, based on the [FLOPROS database] (https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/16/1049/2016/). For each of coastal and riverine inundation, the dataset provides for every location a minimum ("min") and maximum ("max") protection, specified as a return period in years; the min and max reflects in uncertainty in the protection level. The return period indicates that the location is protected against flood events with that return period (e.g. 100 years indicates that the location is protected against 1-in-100 year flood events). Finding the equivalent flood depth protection level additionally requires a flood depth indicator data set.
