The World Resources Institute (WRI) [Aqueduct 4.0](https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-water-risk-atlas) is the latest iteration of WRI’s water risk framework 
designed to translate complex hydrological data into intuitive indicators of 
water-related risk:

1. water stress: the ratio of total water demand to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Water demand includes domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive and nonconsumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive 
water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate more competition among users.

2. water depletion: the ratio of total water consumption to available blue water. Total water consumption includes domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate larger impact on the local water supply and decreased water availability for downstream users.

3. seasonal variability: the average between-year variability of available water supply, including both renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Higher values indicate wider variations in available sup ply from year to year.

The grid resolution is 5 × 5 arc minutes which equates roughly to 10 kilometer (km) × 10 km pixels. 
The future projections were created using CMIP6 climate forcings based on three future scenarios: optimistic (ssp126), business-as-usual (ssp370), and pessimistic (ssp585). Data are presented at the HydroBASINS Level 6 scale. Indicators are available for periods: 'historical' (averaged over 1979-2019), 2030 (2015-2045), 2050 (2035-2065) and 2080 (2065-2095).
