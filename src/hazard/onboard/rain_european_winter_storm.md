Data set of maximum sustained (10 metre) wind speed for various return periods, created by Freie Universit√§t Berlin as part of the [RAIN project](https://data.4tu.nl/collections/1e84bf47-5838-40cb-b381-64d3497b3b36). The original data set provides 5, 10, 20 and 50 year return periods calculated from a generalized extreme value (GEV) fit at approx 40km resolution. This data set also adds 100 and 200 year values inferred from the GEV fit, although it should be understood that these are extrapolated values. Data is available for current period and for two future dates, 2035 and 2085 for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
