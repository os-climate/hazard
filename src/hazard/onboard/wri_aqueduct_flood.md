The World Resources Institute (WRI) [Aqueduct Floods model](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct) is an acute riverine and coastal flood hazard model with a spatial resolution of 30 Ã— 30 arc seconds (approx. 1 km at the equator). Flood intensity is provided as a _return period_ map: each point comprises a curve of inundation depths for 9 different return periods (also known as reoccurrence periods). If a flood event has depth $d_i$ with return period of $r_i$ this implies that the probability of a flood event with depth greater than $d_i$ occurring in any one year is $1 / r_i$; this is the _exceedance probability_. Aqueduct Floods is based on Global Flood Risk with IMAGE Scenarios (GLOFRIS); see [here](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct/publications) for more details.
