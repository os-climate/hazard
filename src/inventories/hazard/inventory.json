            "description": "# Global map of land subsidence rates (Davydzenka et al. (2024))\n\nLand subsidence refers to gradual settlement or rapid sinking of the ground that can occur as a result of natural factors (e.g., volcanic or seismic activity, collapse of subsurface cavities, compaction of loose fine-grained deposits) or anthropogenic activities (e.g., excessive groundwater (GW) abstraction, mining, subsurface energy extraction). It is a destructive phenomenon occurring around the globe causing damage to infrastructure, increased flood risks, and reduction of aquifer storage. However, prediction and quantification of land subsidence rates globally using physics-based methods presents a major challenge. Capitalizing on the robustness of modern deep learning methods and taking advantage of the increasingly available data sets of environmental parameters, the study [here](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104497) introduces the first map of land subsidence rates on a global scale with a spatial resolution of 30 \u00c3\u2014 30 arc seconds (approx. 1 km at the equator).\n\nDavydzenka, T., Tahmasebi, P., & Shokri, N.

The Imperial College Storm Model (IRIS) Dataset. *Sci Data* **11**, 424 (2024). <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03250-y>\n\n## The Imperial College Storm Model (IRIS) Dataset - Scientific Data\nAssessing tropical cyclone risk on a global scale given the infrequency of landfalling tropical cyclones and the short period of reliable observations remains a challenge. Synthetic tropical cyclone datasets can help overcome these problems. Here we present a new global dataset created by IRIS, the ImpeRIal college Storm Model. IRIS is novel because, unlike other synthetic TC models, it only simulates the decay from the point of lifetime maximum intensity. This minimises the bias in the dataset. It takes input from 42 years of observed tropical cyclones and creates a 10,000 year synthetic dataset which is then validated against the observations. IRIS captures important statistical characteristics of the observed data. The return periods of the landfall maximum wind speed (1 minute sustained in m/s) are realistic globally. Climate model projections are used to adjust the life-time maximum intensity.\n\n***Disclaimer***: There have been many improvements on the dataset. Contact Professor Toumi from the Imperial College London for improved data.\n",

Sectoral water demand includes: domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock. Demand is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n- **Water supply**: available blue water, the total amount of renewable freshwater available to a sub-basin with upstream consumption removed, includes surface flow, interflow, and groundwater recharge. Available blue water is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n- **Water stress**: an indicator of competition for water resources defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0: Low (<10%), 1: Low-medium (10-20%), 2: Medium-high (20-40%), 3: High (40-80%), 4: Extremely high (>80%).\n\n- **Water depletion**: the ratio of total water consumption to available renewable water supplies. Total water consumption includes domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate larger impact on the local water supply and decreased water availability for downstream users. Water depletion is similar to water stress; however, instead of looking at total water demand, water depletion is calculated using consumptive withdrawal only. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0 : Low (<5%), 1: Low-medium (5-25%), 2 : Medium-high (25-50%), 3: High (50-75%), 4 : Extremely high (>75%).\n\n[Aqueduct 4.0 FAQ](https://github.com/wri/Aqueduct40/blob/master/data_FAQ.md) explains why the water supply and demand values are measured as fluxes instead of volumes. Volumes (cubic meters) can vary significantly based on the size of each sub-basin, potentially misleading as they might primarily reflect a larger geographical area rather than indicating a higher rate of water flow. On the other hand, fluxes (centimeters/year), which measure the rate of water flow, offer a more direct and equitable means of comparing water availability between different sub-basins. Volume = Flux x Area.\n\nThe spatial resolution is 5 \u00c3\u2014 5 arc minutes which equates roughly to 10 kilometer (km) \u00c3\u2014 10 km pixels.\nThe future projections were created using CMIP6 climate forcings based on three future scenarios: optimistic (ssp126), business-as-usual (ssp370), and pessimistic (ssp585) available at [HYPFLOWSCI6](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/geo/UU01/YM7A5H.html).

It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0: Low (<10%), 1: Low-medium (10-20%), 2: Medium-high (20-40%), 3: High (40-80%), 4: Extremely high (>80%).\n\n- **Water depletion**: the ratio of total water consumption to available renewable water supplies. Total water consumption includes domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate larger impact on the local water supply and decreased water availability for downstream users. Water depletion is similar to water stress; however, instead of looking at total water demand, water depletion is calculated using consumptive withdrawal only. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0 : Low (<5%), 1: Low-medium (5-25%), 2 : Medium-high (25-50%), 3: High (50-75%), 4 : Extremely high (>75%).\n\n[Aqueduct 4.0 FAQ](https://github.com/wri/Aqueduct40/blob/master/data_FAQ.md) explains why the water supply and demand values are measured as fluxes instead of volumes. Volumes (cubic meters) can vary significantly based on the size of each sub-basin, potentially misleading as they might primarily reflect a larger geographical area rather than indicating a higher rate of water flow. On the other hand, fluxes (centimeters/year), which measure the rate of water flow, offer a more direct and equitable means of comparing water availability between different sub-basins.

            "description": "The World Resources Institute (WRI) [Aqueduct 4.0](https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-global-maps-40-data) is the latest iteration of [WRI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water risk framework](https://www.wri.org/data/aqueduct-water-risk-atlas) designed to translate complex\nhydrological data into intuitive indicators of water-related risk:\n\n- **Water demand**: gross demand is the maximum potential water required to meet sectoral demands. Sectoral water demand includes: domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock. Demand is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n- **Water supply**: available blue water, the total amount of renewable freshwater available to a sub-basin with upstream consumption removed, includes surface flow, interflow, and groundwater recharge. Available blue water is displayed as a flux (centimeters/year).\n\n- **Water stress**: an indicator of competition for water resources defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0: Low (<10%), 1: Low-medium (10-20%), 2: Medium-high (20-40%), 3: High (40-80%), 4: Extremely high (>80%).\n\n- **Water depletion**: the ratio of total water consumption to available renewable water supplies. Total water consumption includes domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate larger impact on the local water supply and decreased water availability for downstream users. Water depletion is similar to water stress; however, instead of looking at total water demand, water depletion is calculated using consumptive withdrawal only. It can be classified into six categories: -1: Arid and low water use, 0 : Low (<5%), 1: Low-medium (5-25%), 2 : Medium-high (25-50%), 3: High (50-75%), 4 : Extremely high (>75%).\n\n[Aqueduct 4.0 FAQ](https://github.com/wri/Aqueduct40/blob/master/data_FAQ.md) explains why the water supply and demand values are measured as fluxes instead of volumes. Volumes (cubic meters) can vary significantly based on the size of each sub-basin, potentially misleading as they might primarily reflect a larger geographical area rather than indicating a higher rate of water flow. On the other hand, fluxes (centimeters/year), which measure the rate of water flow, offer a more direct and equitable means of comparing water availability between different sub-basins. Volume = Flux x Area.\n\nThe spatial resolution is 5 \u00c3\u2014 5 arc minutes which equates roughly to 10 kilometer (km) \u00c3\u2014 10 km pixels.\nThe future projections were created using CMIP6 climate forcings based on three future scenarios: optimistic (ssp126), business-as-usual (ssp370), and pessimistic (ssp585) available at [HYPFLOWSCI6](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/geo/UU01/YM7A5H.html). WRI's original data are presented at the HydroBASINS Level 6 scale. Indicators are available for periods: 'historical' (averaged over 1979-2019), 2030 (2015-2045), 2050 (2035-2065) and 2080 (2065-2095).\n",

The RAIN report is\n[here](http://rain-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/D2.5_REPORT_final.pdf).\n\nThe 'River_flood_extent_X_Y_Z_with_protection' data set is obtained by applying FLOPROS database flood protection standards\non top of a data set of unprotected flood depth. That is, it provides information about flood protection for regions susceptible\nto flood. This data set is not simply based on FLOPROS database therefore.\n\nA minimum and maximum is provided to capture uncertainty in flood protection which vulnerability models may choose to take into\naccount. The protection bands are those of FLOPROS: 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 years, 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 years, 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c100 years, 100\u00e2\u20ac\u201c300 years, 300\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1000 years, 1000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10000 years.\n\nAs an example, if a region has a protected extent of 300 years, this is taken to imply that the area is protected against flood within the\nbounds 100-300 years. It is then a modelling choice as to whether protection is taken from the 100 or 300 year flood depth.\n",

The index is expressed in terms of the number of standard deviations from the median (reference period: 1971\u20132010), providing a standardized measure of drought severity.\n\n                    **Calculation & Drought Definition:**\n                    The **SPI** is calculated by comparing cumulated precipitation over \\( n \\) months (commonly \\( n=6 \\) or \\( n=12 \\)) with the long-term precipitation distribution.

For each of coastal and riverine inundation, the dataset provides for every location a minimum (\"min\") and maximum (\"max\") protection, specified as a return period in years; the min and max reflects in uncertainty in the protection level. The return period indicates that the location is protected against flood events with that return period (e.g. 100 years indicates that the location is protected against 1-in-100 year flood events). Finding the equivalent flood depth protection level additionally requires a flood depth indicator data set.\n",
